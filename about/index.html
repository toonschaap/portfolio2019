    <h1>About me</h1>

<h3>My name is Toon Schaap. Currently I'm following a game development study at MediaCollege. Although, game development isn't the end goal for me. For me, it’s overseeing a game. Quite a big goal, I know. So, let me talk about it a bit more.<br/><br/>
Ever since I was young (I’d say when I was between the ages of 6 or 8) I wanted to play video games. I remember that games like Ratchet & Clank and Sly Cooper were two of my main influencers. Although at that age, I really didn’t know what it meant to make video games. As the years went on, my dream evolved as well. Ultimately, I knew at the end of middle school that the game industry was the place I wanted to spend the rest of my life in. Because of this, I followed the study I’m currently doing, which is game development. I wanted to follow this study to really get into the business, as I didn’t have many options besides game artist. I know how to code, but I wouldn't consider me the best around. I know how to work with C#, but I still have much to learn.<br/><br/>
I didn’t really get to experience what I ultimately wanted until the Vertical Slice project came around (A project where we needed to work together with game artists to make 10 second of a game.) During this project I really got the chance to overlook and oversee the creative decisions about this game, together with one other artist in our group. The final project may have had its flaws gameplay wise, but I was very proud of what we made.<br/><br/>
I know the future isn’t going to be easy, quite the opposite. But I know what I want. And I know that when I want something, I’m going to give it my all to get there.
